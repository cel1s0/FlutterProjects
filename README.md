# Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart
* The course contents are outdated, they prepared it before null-safety. 
* There are lots of challenges, got help from student forum, documentation and stackoverflow, I was able to get these work as intended(August 2022).
* If you get stuck any point, it will help. 

Thanks for this amazing course to [Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) and [London App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/).
